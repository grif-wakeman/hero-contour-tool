Ok. Oro “123Go”
KrisSweden’s Mozart track, dunno what it’s called but she brought it to a call once
Banana - Stony Pony
Phoebe check it out
Tleilax- Graham Barton
All 3 spin tracks

can you put my track "get up" on there? the one we used for the masterclass

One of DTB’s orch tracks that ends with a nice rich piano chord button tail


That we’ve been calling a “Chopin button” if that sounds familiar

And 1 or 2 of Danette if they fit the Hero contour well

As many SBA tracks as we can
